This lab focuses on sensitivity of scanning tunneling microscope (STM) and an atomic force
microscope (AFM) along with the behavior of a biprism. Section 2.0 goes in detail about the
simulations, with section 2.1 focusing on the STM and AFM, section 2.1.1 focuses on the variation
in the sensitivity of STM and FAM in lateral and horizontal direction. Further, section 2.1.2
analysis the acceptable thermal noise resistance for atomic level resolution. Moving forward
section 2.1.3 calculates the mass of the AFM cantilever in situation of resonance and without
resonance. Section 2.2 of the simulation deals with Biprism interference with section 2.2.1
focusing on physical setup of the Biprism such that it leads to the fringe width of 1mm. Section
2.2.2 analysis the biprism such that in place of light an electron beam is used and in section 2.2.3
the interference pattern is analyzed using Monte Carlo simulation such that one electron is
interfering with the biprism at a given time. Finally, section 3.0 discusses on the learnings from
this lab.

The files in this repository contain MATLAB code to solve the given problems.
