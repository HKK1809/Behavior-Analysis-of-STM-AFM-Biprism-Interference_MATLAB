% Repeat the calculation in (b) by using a Monte Carlo calculation method rather
% than using the continuous solution to the wave equation. (i.e. randomly transmit
% individual electrons as particles having the same velocity and direction deflected
% through the biprism and then count the linear density (number/length) hitting
% various positions in the observation plane.)
% i) under what assumptions about the electrons do you get no interference?
% ii) what assumptions are required to get results that match part (b)?
% iii) how do the results change if the electrons have a distribution of velocities Î”v?
% iv) how would you incorporate the effects of (iii) into part (b) above?
